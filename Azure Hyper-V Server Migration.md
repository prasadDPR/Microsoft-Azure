# Azure_Hyper-V_Server_Migration
Migrating from an on-premises Hyper-V environment to Azure using Azure Migrate involves a structured process facilitated by Azure tools and services. Here’s a more detailed step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Prepare Azure Environment:**

- **Azure Subscription:** Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.

- **Resource Group:** Create a resource group in Azure where migrated resources will reside.

### 2. **Set up Azure Migrate:**

- **Azure Migrate Project:** Create an Azure Migrate project in the Azure portal.

- **Download Azure Migrate Appliance:** Download and install the Azure Migrate appliance onto a Hyper-V host in your on-premises environment. This appliance facilitates the discovery and assessment of your Hyper-V VMs.

### 3. **Discovery and Assessment:**

- **Discover Hyper-V VMs:** Use the Azure Migrate appliance to discover all the Hyper-V VMs in your environment.

- **Assessment:** Perform assessments to evaluate compatibility, performance, and dependencies of the discovered VMs. This step helps in estimating costs and planning the migration.

### 4. **Azure Target Setup:**

- **Create Target Resources:** Set up the necessary resources in Azure to accommodate the migrated VMs (Virtual Network, Storage Accounts, etc.).

- **Select VM Configurations:** Based on assessment results, choose appropriate Azure VM sizes and configurations that match your Hyper-V VM requirements.

### 5. **Replication and Migration:**

- **Replication Setup:** Configure replication from your on-premises Hyper-V environment to Azure using Azure Site Recovery (ASR) or other replication methods recommended by Azure Migrate.

- **Test Failover:** Conduct failover tests to ensure that the replicated VMs can be successfully migrated to Azure and run properly.

- **Final Migration:** Initiate the final migration by performing failover from the on-premises Hyper-V environment to Azure.

### 6. **Post-Migration Tasks:**

- **Validation:** Verify that the migrated VMs are functioning correctly in Azure. Test connectivity, applications, and services to ensure they are working as expected.

- **Network and Configuration Updates:** Update DNS, network configurations, and any necessary settings to reflect changes due to the migration.

### 7. **Optimization and Clean-up:**

- **Optimize Resources:** Fine-tune Azure resources based on performance data collected post-migration for optimal usage.

- **Decommission On-Premises VMs:** Once you've confirmed the successful migration, decommission or shut down the on-premises Hyper-V VMs to avoid redundancy and unnecessary costs.

Throughout this process, consider factors like network connectivity, security measures, compliance, and licensing for the software running on the VMs. Azure Migrate provides a structured approach to help simplify the migration process while ensuring minimal disruptions and a successful transition to the Azure cloud.
